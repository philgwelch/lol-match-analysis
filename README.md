# League of Legends match analysis

## This notebook is designed to see whether we can determine which team will go on to win a LoL match, based on the first 15 minutes of play

### The data were made available by Ben Fattori on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/benfattori/league-of-legends-diamond-games-first-15-minutes) and this analysis is heavily inspired by Ken Jee's analysis of the Titanic dataset (on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/kenjee/titanic-project-example) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3FBJdiExcg&t=0s))
